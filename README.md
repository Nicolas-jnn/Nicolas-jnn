### Welcome to Nicolas' GitHub Repository!

## About Me
I'm Nicolas, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering at EPFL (Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne). I'm here to share some of my projects and learn the world of coding and engineering.

## My Interests
While I'm deeply engaged in chemical engineering studies, I have a few other interests that keep me curious:

- Machine Learning: Exploring the realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms fascinates me.
- Lab Automation: I'm particularly intrigued by the automation of laboratory processes, aiming to streamline experimentation and enhance efficiency.


## Get in Touch
Whether you have questions about my projects feel free to reach out to me via email at nicolas.jenni@epfl.ch or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-jenni-984422267/).


Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to sharing and learning together! ðŸš€
